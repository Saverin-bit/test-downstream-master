2.14.1
------
* Update card.io to 5.3.2.

2.14.0
------
* Updated `minSdkVersion` to 16.  This is the minimum Android version to communicate over TLSv1.2, which is required to support [a Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council mandate](http://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls). All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, [PayPal is updating its services](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) to require TLSv1.2 for all HTTPS connections. To override the minSdkVersion, please see [the readme](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Android-SDK/blob/develop/sdk/README.md#override-minsdkversion).

2.9.0

Note: this method requires the use of the [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html), due to its use of `LocalBroadcastManager`.  This SDK can still be used without the support library, but this method will not function.
